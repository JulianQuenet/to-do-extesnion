# to-do-extension

## About
Created this extension as a side project for fun and to play around with the lit framework.

### Features 
- All added tasks are draggable that haven't been completed yet, meaning one can changes the tasks urgency by dragging it to the desired field.
- When a task is completed it will be added to the completed box where it can be deleted if desired.
- In the top left corner there is a task counter to keep track of all incomplete tasks
- If it is desired a task can be deleted by dragging it over to the delete box where it will be removed.
- The tasks list can be minimized and maximized by clicking on the to-do logo, however it won't perform this action when adding a new task.
